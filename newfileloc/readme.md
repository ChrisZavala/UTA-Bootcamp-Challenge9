  # The Professional README Generator 

  ## Description 
  The task that I have been provided is, When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

  ## Features
  The short list of features for this READme that is more than I have been including in previous version of the READme in the challenges is creating the license badge. Also including a hyperlink to the live site for the project on GitHub Paages.

  ## How to Contribute
  I would like to contact the developer of this project to see if he would like my help. I can be reached at frappjcat@gmail.com

  ## Test
  The user can test the application by creating as many versions of the READme they like. They could of course answer very breif questions and then go back to insert more content to make it more robust!
